A place to put my planned work across a multiple iteration release schedule:

Phase 3 Race Calendar:

(Note `Stage Profile Categories`, `Distance` and `Route` for One Day races is from same scrape)
(Note `Race Winner` is possible through scrape and no transformation but doesn't allow for sustainable iterations for future ideas)
