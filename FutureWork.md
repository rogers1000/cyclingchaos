A place to put my planned work across a multiple iteration release schedule:

Phase 5:
- Redesign Race Calendar ETL
- Redesign Race Results ETL

- Start design for Rider Details ETL

Phase 6:
- Redesign `Pivot_Results()` with new ETL process

Phase 7:

- Look into data views for `Rider Details()` (`UCI Points`, `Victories`, `Top3s`, `Top10s`, `Race Days`)
- Velogames Data
