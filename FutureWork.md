A place to put my planned work across a multiple iteration release schedule:

Phase 7:
- Add 2024 Data to existing capabilities

Phase 8:
- Look into UCI Website for Ingestion
- Look into Olympics Website for Ingestion
- Look into Paralympics Website for Ingestion

Future Work:
- Transform KOM Data into `RaceResults()`
- Transform Points Data into `RaceResults()`
- Transform Youth Data into `RaceResults()`
- Transform Team GC Data into `RaceResults()`
- Race Nationality ID -> Name Mapping DF
- Look into transforming Hex Codes for Teams (ingested already)
- Look into aggregated data views for `Team Details()` (`UCI Points`, `Victories`, `Top3s`, `Top10s`, `Race Days`)
- Look into data views for `Rider Details()` (`UCI Points`, `Victories`, `Top3s`, `Top10s`, `Race Days`)
- Velogames Data
- Cyclocross24
